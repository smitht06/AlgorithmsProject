Name: Tony Smith and Andrew Hartsfield

April 13, 2021: TS: Created Variable and Clause class, started basic derandomization
April 14, 2021: TS: Fixed math and added clauses to derandomization, refactored methods for readability
April 14, 2021: AH: Derandomization can now read from file and create clauses and variables from input file.
April 15, 2021: AH: Refactor for readability and remove unused variables
April 17, 2021: AH: Add more variables/ clauses in file. Remove more unnecessary variables/ arguments. Remove variable
from clause when set to false.
April 20, 2021: TS: Add randomization algorithm
April 21, 2021: TS: Change cost to double and add all variables
April 21, 2021: AH: Add all clauses, update budget to true number
April 22, 2021: AH: Add bash script for compilation and running, change weight to thousands of people, change weight to
double
April 27, 2021: AH: Add output files
April 29, 2021: TS: Make clauses saitisfied only if half variables are true for randomized
April 29, 2021: AH: Make clauses saitisfied only if half variables are true for derandomized
